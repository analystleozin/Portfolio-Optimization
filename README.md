Portfolio Optimization with R Studio
This repository explores portfolio management and backtesting strategies using R and modern portfolio theory. It features three portfolios built and optimized with U.S. and international equities, bonds, gold, and digital assets, using data from 2020 onward sourced via Yahoo Finance.

The project highlights the impact of diversification and asset reallocation on portfolio performance under different scenarios. Key portfolio adjustments include reallocating bonds to gold and adding Bitcoin to assess risk-adjusted returns in light of recent macroeconomic trends.

Optimizations aim to minimize risk and maximize returns, adhering to constraints like full investment and balanced asset exposure (10%-40% per asset). Results show improved risk-adjusted returns through optimization, demonstrating R's capability in portfolio analysis and modern portfolio theory.

Graphs and analysis were generated in R, with the full code available for reference in this repository.
